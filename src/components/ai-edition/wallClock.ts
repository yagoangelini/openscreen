/**
 * Makes a media element keep time by the wall clock instead of by playing (issue #994).
 *
 * The preview's `<video>` and `<audio>` only keep time: the native compositor draws every
 * pixel. A recording with sound keeps time on its sound track, its picture deselected
 * (`dropVideoTrack`). A recording without sound has nothing else to keep time with, so
 * Chromium decoded its picture on the GPU, twice (the `<video>` and the `<audio>`), at the
 * speed region's rate, against the compositor's own decode of the same file. Measured on an
 * RTX 4070 Ti with a hidden Electron playing a soundless 4K60 file the way the editor does,
 * next to the compositor's free-run at 3x: the view fell 3.5 s of playback behind; with one
 * Chromium decode left, 2.8 s; with this clock, 0.01 s, as with no Chromium at all.
 *
 * An element given this clock never plays for real: `play`, `pause`, `paused`, `ended`,
 * `currentTime` and `playbackRate` are answered by a clock that runs `playbackRate` times the
 * wall clock from where it was last placed, and it fires `play`, `playing`, `pause` and `ended`
 * as a playing element would. A seek still reaches the element, so `seeking` and `seeked` stay
 * real, and with no track selected it decodes nothing. Anything else is the element's own.
